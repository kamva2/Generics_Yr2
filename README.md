In this Project, I was implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java. The task involves designing classes to represent the structure of the BST and implementing key operations such as insertion, deletion, and search. Additionally, I may have implement tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order), calculate the height of the tree, and check for balance. The project emphasizes understanding the recursive nature of BST algorithms, efficient data organization, and applying object-oriented programming principles. I am show-casing what I am learning in class.
